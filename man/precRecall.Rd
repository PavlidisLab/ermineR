\usage{
precRecall(scores, scoreColumn = 1, bigIsBetter = FALSE, logTrans = FALSE,
  annotation = NULL, aspects = c("Molecular Function", "Cellular Component",
  "Biological Process"), iterations = 10000, geneReplicates = c("mean",
  "best"), pAdjust = c("FDR", "Bonferroni"),

}
\arguments{
\item{scores}{A data.frame. Rownames have to be gene identifiers (eg. probes,
must be unique), followed by any number of columns. The column used for
scoring is chosen by \code{scoreColumn}. See
\url{http://erminej.msl.ubc.ca/help/input-files/gene-scores/} for
information abot how to specify scores. (for test = ORA, GSR and ROC)}

\item{scoreColumn}{Integer or character. Which column of the \code{scores} data.frame
to use as scores. Defaults to first column of \code{scores}. See
\url{http://erminej.msl.ubc.ca/help/input-files/gene-scores/} for details.
(for test = ORA, GSR and ROC)}

\item{bigIsBetter}{Logical. If TRUE large scores are considered to be higher.
\code{FALSE} by default (as in p values).}

\item{logTrans}{Logical. Should the data be -log10 transformed. Recommended for 
p values. \code{FALSE} by default}

\item{annotation}{Annotation. A file path, a data.frame or a platform short 
name (eg. GPL127). If given a platform short name it will be downloaded
from annotation repository of Pavlidis Lab (\url{www.chibi.ubc.ca/microannots/}). 
Note that if there is a file or folder with the same name as the platform 
name in the directory, that file will be read instead of getting a copy from 
Pavlidis Lab. If this file isn't a valid annotation file, the function will fail.
If providing a custom annotation file, see \code{\link{makeAnnotation}} to do it from
R or  \url{erminej.msl.ubc.ca/help/input-files/gene-annotations/} to do it manually.

If you are providing a custom gene set, you can leave annotation as NULL}

\item{aspects}{Character vector. Which Go aspects to include in the analysis.
Can be in long form (eg. 'Molecular Function') or short form (eg. \code{c('M','C','B')})}

\item{iterations}{Number of iterations. We suggest a starting value of 10000 
iterations. When you decide on parameters you like, we recommend a larger
number of iterations (perhaps 200,000 or more). This is to get sufficient
precision in the p-values to make multiple-test correction work correctly. 
(test = GSR CORR and precRecall methods only)}

\item{geneReplicates}{What to do when genes have multiple scores in input file
(due to multiple probes per gene)}

\item{pAdjust}{Which multiple test correction method to use. Can be "FDR" or
'Westfall-Young' (slower).}

\item{geneSetDescription}{"Latest_GO", a file path that leads to a GO XML or OBO file
or a URL that leads to a go ontology file that ends with rdf-xml.gz. 

If you left annotation as NULL and provided customGeneSets, this argument is
not required and will default to NULL. Otherwise, by default it'll be set to
"Latest_GO" which downloads the latest available GO XML file. This option won't work
without an internet connection. To get a frozen file
that you can use later, see \code{\link{goToday}}, \code{\link{goAtDate}} and \code{\link{getGoDates}}.
 See \url{http://erminej.msl.ubc.ca/help/input-files/gene-set-descriptions/}
for details.}

\item{customGeneSets}{Path to a directory that contains custom gene set files,
 paths to custom gene set files themselves or a named list of character strings.
Use this option to create your own gene sets. If you provide directory you can
specify probes or gene symbols to include in your gene sets. 
See \url{http://erminej.msl.ubc.ca/help/input-files/gene-sets/}
for information about format for this file. If you are providing a list, only gene
symbols are accepted.}

\item{minClassSize}{minimum class size}

\item{maxClassSize}{maximum class size}

\item{output}{Output file name.}

\item{return}{If results should be returned. Set to FALSE if you only want a file}
}
\description{
Precision-recall curves are a standard way to analyze the
  quality of a classifier, as are \code{\link{roc}} curves. The difference
  between ROC and Precision-recall (PR) is that PR is mostly concerned with
  what is happening at the top of the ranking, while ROC looks at the whole
  ranking. The precision-recall method in ErmineJ is similar in intent to the
  method popularized in “GSEA“, but uses standard precision-recall (GSEA
  originally used Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistics, but was changed to use a
  modified K-S statistic that makes it more precision-recall-like).
  
  Like the ROC method, the PRC method uses only the ranks of the gene scores.
  That is, all it cares about is the ordering of items obtained by your gene 
  scores (e.g., t-test or fold-change), but doesn’t use the information about
  the relative values of the scores.
  
  PR-scoring is rather like the ORA method in that it is concerned with what
  is going on at the “top” of your list, but unlike ORA it does not use a 
  threhold. Thus PR-scoring would be appropriate whenever you consider the
  ORA method appropriate. The PR method requires a resampling step, so it is
  slower to run than ORA.
